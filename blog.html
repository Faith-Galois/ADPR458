                <p>This semester I took a Life Drawing class with one of my good friends and we were able to 
                    collaborate on our final project. We went back and forth on a lot of different ideas but we
                    finally decided to try cyanotype. My friend had some extra cyanotype papers for printing so we
                    were able to get started right away. Cyanotype works by printing with the sun, so you have to lay
                    what you want to print over the paper and let it sit out in the sun for about 10 minutes. We went 
                    out and collected some flowers on campus and found a nice sunny spot to do our "printing." We then 
                    took turns being the director of eachothers prints but laying out the pages and positioning the other
                    person and the flowers around the scene. Next, we layed out a cluster of flowers and put our hands on
                    top of them reaching for it. After they are done printing we had to quickly put them back in their
                    black bag so they wouldn't be contaminated by more light. Then we had to rinse the papers off with
                    water to deactivate the chemical that causes the light to darked it the paper. Finally, after they all
                    dried, we both drew eachothers faces in more detail back into the composition using a white charcoal pencil.
